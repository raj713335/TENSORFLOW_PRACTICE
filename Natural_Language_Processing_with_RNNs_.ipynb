        "Natural Language Processing (or NLP for short) is a discipline in computing that deals with the communication between natural (human) languages and computer languages. A common example of NLP is something like spellcheck or autocomplete. Essentially NLP is the field that focuses on how computers can understand and/or process natural/human languages. \n",

        "\n",
        "But what do I mean by sequences and why is text data a sequence? Well that's a good question. Since textual data contains many words that follow in a very specific and meaningful order, we need to be able to keep track of each word and when it occurs in the data. Simply encoding say an entire paragraph of text into one data point wouldn't give us a very meaningful picture of the data and would be very difficult to do anything with. This is why we treat text as a sequence and process one word at a time. We will keep track of where each of these words appear and use that information to try to understand the meaning of peices of text.\n",

This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for processing text. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. Well this is exaclty what a recurrent neural network is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop.

With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time.
